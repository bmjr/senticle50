  abstract = {This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., "subtle nuances") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., "very cavalier"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "excellent" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word "poor". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74\% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84\% for automobile reviews to 66\% for movie reviews.},

  abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

  abstract = {Knowing the reputations of your own and/or competitors' products is important for marketing and customer relationship management. It is, however, very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually. This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet. It automatically collects people's opinions about target products from Web pages, and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products.On the basis of human-test samples, we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not, as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature. We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine, and then, using the rules, extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion, labels indicating the positive/negative determination, the product name itself, and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is, in fact, an opinion. The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database.The mining of reputations, i.e., the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database, is then conducted. We specify target categories using label values (such as positive opinions of product A) and perform four types of text mining: extraction of 1) characteristic words, 2) co-occurrence words, 3) typical sentences, for individual target categories, and 4) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories.Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework, which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web.},

  abstract = {The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., "honest", "intrepid") and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., "disturbing", "superfluous"). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This article introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8\% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95\% when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.},

  abstract = {The new transformed read-write Web has resulted in a rapid growth of user generated content on the Web resulting into a huge volume of unstructured data. A substantial part of this data is unstructured text such as reviews and blogs. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (OMSA) as a research discipline has emerged during last 15 years and provides a methodology to computationally process the unstructured data mainly to extract opinions and identify their sentiments. The relatively new but fast growing research discipline has changed a lot during these years. This paper presents a scientometric analysis of research work done on OMSA during 2000\textendash{}2016. For the scientometric mapping, research publications indexed in Web of Science (WoS) database are used as input data. The publication data is analyzed computationally to identify year-wise publication pattern, rate of growth of publications, types of authorship of papers on OMSA, collaboration patterns in publications on OMSA, most productive countries, institutions, journals and authors, citation patterns and an year-wise citation reference network, and theme density plots and keyword bursts in OMSA publications during the period. A somewhat detailed manual analysis of the data is also performed to identify popular approaches (machine learning and lexicon-based) used in these publications, levels (document, sentence or aspect-level) of sentiment analysis work done and major application areas of OMSA. The paper presents a detailed analytical mapping of OMSA research work and charts the progress of discipline on various useful parameters.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report research results investigating microblogging as a form of electronic word-of-mouth for sharing consumer opinions concerning brands. We analyzed more than 150,000 microblog postings containing branding comments, sentiments, and opinions. We investigated the overall structure of these microblog postings, the types of expressions, and the movement in positive or negative sentiment. We compared automated methods of classifying sentiment in these microblogs with manual coding. Using a case study approach, we analyzed the range, frequency, timing, and content of tweets in a corporate account. Our research findings show that 19\% of microblogs contain mention of a brand. Of the branding microblogs, nearly 20\% contained some expression of brand sentiments. Of these, more than 50\% were positive and 33\% were critical of the company or product. Our comparison of automated and manual coding showed no significant differences between the two approaches. In analyzing microblogs for structure and composition, the linguistic structure of tweets approximate the linguistic patterns of natural language expressions. We find that microblogging is an online tool for customer word of mouth communications and discuss the implications for corporations using microblogging as part of their overall marketing strategy. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Supervised machine learning techniques can perform this task very effectively. However, they require a large corpus of training data, and a number of studies have demonstrated that the good performance of supervised models is dependent on a good match between the training and testing data with respect to the domain, topic and time-period. Weakly-supervised techniques use a large collection of unlabelled text to determine sentiment, and so their performance may be less dependent on the domain, topic and time-period represented by the testing data. This paper presents experiments that investigate the effectiveness of word similarity techniques when performing weakly-supervised sentiment classification. It also considers the extent to which the performance of each method is independent from the domain, topic and time-period of the testing data. The results indicate that the word similarity techniques are suitable for applications that require sentiment classification across several domains.},

  abstract = {Opinion mining (OM) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the "PN-polarity" of subjective terms, i.e. identify whether a term that is a marker of opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining whether a term is indeed a marker of opinionated content (a subjective term) or not (an objective term) has been, instead, much more scarce. In this work we describe SENTIWORDNET, a lexical resource in which each WORDNET synset s is associated to three numerical scores Obj(s), Pos(s) and Neg(s), describing how objective, positive, and negative the terms contained in the synset are. The method used to develop SENTIWORDNET is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The three scores are derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, all characterized by similar accuracy levels but different classification behaviour. SENTIWORDNET is freely available for research purposes, and is endowed with a Web-based graphical user interface.},

  abstract = {In lexicon-based sentiment classification, the problem of contextual polarity must be explicitly handled since it is a major cause for classification error. One way to handle contextual polarity is to revise the prior polarity of the sentiment dictionary to fit the domain. This paper presents a data-driven method of adapting sentiment dictionaries to diverse domains. Our method first merges multiple sentiment dictionaries at the entry word level to expand the dictionary. Then, leveraging the ratio of the positive/negative training data, it selectively removes the entry words that do not contribute to the classification. Finally, it selectively switches the sentiment polarity of the entry words to adapt to the domain. In essence, our method compares the positive/negative review's dictionary word occurrence ratios with the positive/negative review ratio itself to determine which entry words to be removed and which entry words' sentiment polarity to be switched. We show that the integrated sentiment dictionary constructed using our `merge', `remove', and `switch' operations robustly outperforms individual dictionaries in the sentiment classification of product reviews across different domains such as smartphones, movies, and books.},

A number of approaches have been proposed for creating such lexicons, but they tend to be computationally expensive, and usually rely on significant manual annotation and large corpora. Most of these methods use WordNet. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to generate a high-coverage semantic orientation lexicon, which includes both individual words and multi-word expressions, using only a Roget-like thesaurus and a handful of affixes. Further, the lexicon has properties that support the Polyanna Hypothesis. Using the General Inquirer as gold standard, we show that our lexicon has 14 percentage points more correct entries than the leading WordNet-based high-coverage lexicon (SentiWordNet). In an extrinsic evaluation, we obtain significantly higher performance in determining phrase polarity using our thesaurus-based lexicon than with any other. Additionally, we explore the use of visualization techniques to gain insight into the our algorithm beyond the evaluations mentioned above.},

  abstract = {Microblogging is a form of online communication by which users broadcast brief text updates, also known as tweets, to the public or a selected circle of contacts. A variegated mosaic of microblogging uses has emerged since the launch of Twitter in 2006: daily chatter, conversation, information sharing, and news commentary, among others. Regardless of their content and intended use, tweets often convey pertinent information about their author's mood status. As such, tweets can be regarded as temporally-authentic microscopic instantiations of public mood state. In this article, we perform a sentiment analysis of all public tweets broadcasted by Twitter users between August 1 and December 20, 2008. For every day in the timeline, we extract six dimensions of mood (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) using an extended version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a well-established psychometric instrument. We compare our results to fluctuations recorded by stock market and crude oil price indices and major events in media and popular culture, such as the U.S. Presidential Election of November 4, 2008 and Thanksgiving Day. We find that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have a significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions of public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a solid platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive value with regards to existing social as well as economic indicators.},

Internet has become a platform for online learning, exchanging ideas and sharing opinions. Social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google+ are rapidly gaining popularity as they allow people to share and express their views about topics,have discussion with different communities, or post messages across the world. There has been lot of work in the field of sentiment analysis of twitter data. This survey focuses mainly on sentiment analysis of twitter data which is helpful to analyze the information in the tweets where opinions are highly unstructured, heterogeneous and are either positive or negative, or neutral in some cases. In this paper, we provide a survey and a comparative analyses of existing techniques for opinion mining like machine learning and lexicon-based approaches, together with evaluation metrics. Using various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Max Entropy, and Support Vector Machine, we provide a research on twitter data streams.General challenges and applications of Sentiment Analysis on Twitter are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging website where users read and write millions of short messages on a variety of topics every day. This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a content-analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets\&rsquo; political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians\&rsquo; political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research.},

This article utilizes emerging online tools and presents a rationale for data collection and analysis of Twitter users. The suggested approach is exemplified with a case study: Twitter use during the 2010 Swedish election. Although many of the initial hopes for e-democracy appear to have gone largely unfulfilled, the successful employment of the internet during the 2008 US presidential campaign has again raised voices claiming that the internet, and particularly social media applications like Twitter, provides interesting opportunities for online campaigning and deliberation. Besides providing an overarching analysis of how Twitter use was fashioned during the 2010 Swedish election campaign, this study identifies different user types based on how high-end users utilized the Twitter service. By suggesting a novel approach to the study of microblogging and by identifying user types, this study contributes to the burgeoning field of microblog research and gives specific insights into the practice of civic microblogging.},

The real-time analytics framework comprises semantic annotation, Linked Open Data, semantic search, and dynamic result aggregation components. In addition, exploratory search and sense-making are supported through information visualisation interfaces, such as co-occurrence matrices, term clouds, treemaps, and choropleths. There is also an interactive semantic search interface (Prospector), where users can save, refine, and analyse the results of semantic search queries over time. Practical use of the framework is exemplified through three case studies: a general scenario analysing tweets from UK politicians and the public's response to them in the run up to the 2015 UK general election, an investigation of attitudes towards climate change expressed by these politicians and the public, via their engagement with environmental topics, and an analysis of public tweets leading up to the UK's referendum on leaving the EU (Brexit) in 2016. The paper also presents a brief evaluation and discussion of some of the key text analysis components, which are specifically adapted to the domain and task, and demonstrate scalability and efficiency of our toolkit in the case studies.},
